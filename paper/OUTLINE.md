% From Proof to Measurement: A Lean‑Verified Reality Bridge for Physics
% Outline and writing scaffold (to be converted to full LaTeX).

1. Introduction
   - Motivation: parameter‑free derivation + meter‑native bridge.
   - Contributions: sorry‑free core; single Reality Bridge; SI identities; classical correspondences; reproducibility.

2. Background and Method
   - Lean/Mathlib footprint; namespaces layout; artifact policy.
   - Bridge concept: semantics not tunables; non‑circularity sketch.

3. Core Dimensionless Results (Lean)
   - Unique cost J(x)=½(x+1/x); T5 log‑axis EL equivalence; φ fixed‑point + uniqueness.
   - Eight‑tick minimality (T7 threshold statement); δ_gap = ln φ.

4. The Reality Bridge (Meter‑Native Semantics)
   - Statement of the bridge; unit‑quotient non‑circularity; composition laws.
   - Meter‑native identities: λ_rec = √(ħG/c^3), τ_rec = 2π/(8 ln φ), E_coh ∝ φ^-5 (symbolic).
   - Lean hooks for SI equalities and π‑normalized variant.

5. Classical Correspondences (Lean bridges)
   - Continuity: discrete→continuum schema via coarse‑graining/ Riemann sums.
   - Gauge (T4): potentials unique up to constant on components.
   - Variational (T5): EL equivalence on log axis, local convexity/minimum.

6. Constants and Hooks (Reproducible)
   - φ lemmas, delta_gap, tau_rec, lambda_rec, Ecoh relation; positivity/non‑zero lemmas; rewrite equalities.
   - SI calibration lemmas; explicit c‑rewrite; λ_rec π‑normalization link.

7. Spectra Demonstrator (Structure Only)
   - Mass law scaffolding: m = B·E_coh·φ^(r+f); positivity/monotonicity; zpow ratios; Ecoh relation rewrite.
   - One short walk‑through (no numerics).

8. Reproducibility and Artifact
   - Repository layout; build instructions; lemma/def list; stable tag; how LaTeX cites Lean names.

9. Limitations and Future Work
   - What is deferred to the full theory paper (ILG, cosmology, full spectra, biology/number theory excursions).

10. Conclusion
   - A Lean‑verified, meter‑native bridge closes the derivation‑to‑measurement gap without parameters.
